# This sets up boot2docker, telling Virtualbox to forward 127.0.0.1:2376
# on to the boot2docker-vm, so that you can set DOCKER_HOST to the
# local port and things Finally Fucking Work :tm:.

# You only need this for a new boot2docker-vm instance. I am keeping it
# here so I don't have to google this shit every time.
